11.11 (Polynomial Class) 
Develop class Polynomial. The internal representation of a Polynomial is an array of terms.
Each term contains a coefficient and an exponent, e.g., the term 2x 4 has the coefficient 2
and the exponent 4. Develop a complete class containing proper constructor and destructor
functions as well as set and get functions. The class should also provide the following 
overloaded operator capabilities: 
  a) Overload the addition operator (+) to add two Polynomials. 
  b) Overload the subtraction operator (-) to subtract two Polynomials. 
  c) Overload the assignment operator to assign one Polynomial to another. 
  d) Overload the multiplication operator (*) to multiply two Polynomials. 
  e) Overload the addition assignment operator (+=), subtraction assignment operator (-=), 
    and multiplication assignment operator (*=).
