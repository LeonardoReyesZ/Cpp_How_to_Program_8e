Write a simple function template for predicate function isEqualTo that compares its two 
  arguments of the same type with the equality operator (==) and returns true if they are 
  equal and false otherwise. Use this function template in a program that calls isEqualTo 
  only with a variety of fundamental types. Now write a separate version of the program 
  thatcalls isEqualTo with a user-defined class type, but does not overload the equality 
operator. What happens when you attempt to run this program? Now overload the equality 
operator (with the operator function) operator==. Now what happens when you attempt to run 
this program?
